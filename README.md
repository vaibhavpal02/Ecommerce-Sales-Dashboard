# Ecommerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This is an interactive dashboard I built in Power BI to analyze Ecommerce sales data.  
The idea was to understand sales performance, profit trends, customer behavior, and regional growth.  

## Dashboard Highlights
- KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold, Avg Order Value  
- Sales by Category & Sub-Category  
- Sales by State & Region  
- Payment Modes used by customers  
- Month-wise profit trends  

## Tools Used
- Power BI  
- Power Query (data cleaning)  
- DAX (measures and KPIs)  

## Key Insights
- Clothing had the highest sales share (~63%)  
- Maharashtra and Delhi were top states for revenue  
- COD (Cash on Delivery) was the most preferred payment mode  
- January saw the highest profit among all months  

## How to View
- Download the `.pbix` file and open it in Power BI Desktop  
- Use filters (Quarter, Category, State) to explore data
